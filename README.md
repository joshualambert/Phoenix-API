# Phoenix-API for Minecraft

Get information about any minecraft server at any time.

## Description

This class was created for developers to be able to get any information about a Minecraft server.<br>
It works starting from **Minecraft 1.0** and uses the Phoenix-API for minecraft (http://api.iamphoenix.me/)<br>
Some of these functions require the server to have query or rcon enabled.<br>

Look for these settings in **server.properties**:<br>

**Query**<br>
> *enable-query=true*<br>
> *query.port=25565*<br>

**RCON**<br>
> enable-rcon=true<br>
> rcon.password=

## PHP or Java?

There is both a PHP and Java version for this library so you easily can embed these functions into your application, plugin or website.
